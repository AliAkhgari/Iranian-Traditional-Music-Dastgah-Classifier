# Iranian-Traditional-Music-Dastgah-Classifier

Iranian traditional music is distinguished by its seven primary Dastgahs: Chahargah, Homayoun, Mahour, Segah, Shour, Nava, and Rast-Panjgah. Within the scope of this project, we constructed a classifier aimed at discerning the Dastgah to which each music track is affiliated. Additionally, we applied clustering techniques to group similar music tracks based on their audio features. This project also encompassed tasks such as gathering suitable music tracks, preprocessing audio signals, extracting relevant features, and assembling a notably informative dataset.
